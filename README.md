## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd StudentManagementSystem
```

### 2. Database Setup

1.  Make sure your MySQL server is running.
2.  Connect to your MySQL instance and run the following SQL script to create the database and the `students` table:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS student_db;

    USE student_db;

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
        Id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        Email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
        DateOfBirth DATE NOT NULL
    );
    ```

### 3. Backend Configuration

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend/StudentManagement.Api
    ```
2.  Open the `appsettings.json` file.
3.  Update the `DefaultConnection` string with your MySQL username and password:
    ```json
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "server=localhost;port=3306;database=student_db;user=your_mysql_user;password=your_mysql_password"
    }
    ```
4.  Restore the dependencies and run the backend server:
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    dotnet run
    ```
    The API should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5267`. You can verify this by navigating to `http://localhost:5267/swagger`.

### 4. Frontend Configuration

1.  Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the required npm packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The React application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

You should now have the full application running and be able to interact with the student data.
